These esRNAs are produced by a degradation pathway in which the RdRP proteins signal specific transcripts that will be degraded by a newly identified RNase.  Depending on the proteins of the RNAi machinery required for their biogenesis, these ex-siRNAs can be classified into four different classes, all of which are dicer-dependent, since they require one of the M. circinelloides Dicer-like (Dcl) proteins for their biogenesis. The main class of the dicer-dependent ex-siRNAs (class II) requires Dcl-2 [12] and RdRP-1 [13], an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for activation of silencing with single stranded RNA molecules by producing antisense RNA transcripts. Only a small group of dcl-2-dependent ex-siRNAs (class I) does not require RdRP-1 for their biogenesis, but most of them require RdRP-2 [13], which is involved in the amplification process that produce secondary siRNAs. These two classes are specifically bound to Ago-1, one of the three M. circinelloides Argonaute proteins [14] and are accumulated at a reduced extent in the ago-1- mutants, suggesting that they require Ago-1 for their biogenesis/stability. Class III corresponds to ex-siRNAs that can be generated by either Dcl-1 or Dcl-2 and require both RdRP-1 and RdRP-2, and class IV is a tiny group of ex-siRNAs that depends on dcl-1 [15] but not on dcl-2 [11].</p>"},{"location":"question_answers/","title":"QA Section","text":""},{"location":"question_answers/#1-why-do-we-care-about-h3k9me23-but-not-h3k9me","title":"1.
