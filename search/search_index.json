Retrotransposon is a type of genetic component that copies and pastes itself into different genomic locations by converting RNA back into DNA through a process called reverse transcription. This process is catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Retrotransposon normally uses an RNA transposition intermediate. Class I transposable elements are usually copied in two stages. First, they are transcribed from DNA to RNA. Then the RNA produced is then reverse transcribed to DNA. Later, this copied DNA is inserted back into the genome at a new position.
