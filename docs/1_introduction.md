* The functions and types of centromere
    - Mediates binding of the kinetochore and microtubules
    - Kinetochore assembles on histone H3 variant (CENP-A in this study)
    - Regional and point centromeres

* Fungal regional centromeres
    - The pericentric regions of centromeres in *Candida albicans*
        - Enriched: euchromatic histone marks H3K9Ac and H4K16Ac
        - Hypomethylated: H3K4, a feature of heterochromatic chromatin
    
    - The mixture of euchromatin and heterochromatin results in reduced expression of genes located in proximity to the centromeres.
    - Native centromeres of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*
        - CENP-A-enriched central core
        - Flanked by heterochromatic inner and outer repeats
    - The pericentric regions of centromeres in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*
        - Enriched: H3K9me2/3, which is RNAi-dependent
    for the euchromatic histone marks H3K9Ac and H4K16Ac but are hypomethylated at H3K4,
    a feature of heterochromatic chromatin.
